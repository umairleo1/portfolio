# Deployment Guide

This document outlines the fully automated deployment system for the portfolio website.

## 🚀 Automated GitHub Pages Deployment (Current)

The portfolio uses a **professional CI/CD pipeline** that automatically handles deployment with zero manual intervention.

### How It Works

**Simply push to main branch:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: update portfolio content"
git push origin main
```

**Automatic process:**

1. ✅ **Quality Validation** - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tests
2. ✅ **Security Audit** - Critical vulnerability scanning
3. ✅ **Production Build** - Optimized React build with `CI: false`
4. ✅ **Live Deployment** - Automatic GitHub Pages deployment

**Result:** Portfolio is live at https://umairleo1.github.io/portfolio in ~3 minutes

### For Contributors (Pull Requests)

When contributors create PRs:

```bash
# Contributor workflow
git fork → git clone → git branch → git commit → git push → create PR
```

**Automatic validation:**

- ✅ All quality checks run
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Security scanning
- ❌ **NO deployment** (validation only)

**After PR merge:** Automatic deployment to live site

### Workflow Configuration

The deployment is managed by `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

- **Node.js 20** - Single, stable version
- **Professional actions** - Latest GitHub actions
- **Optimized performance** - Minimal, efficient pipeline
- **Enterprise standards** - Same as React, Next.js

## 🔧 Manual Deployment (Backup)

If automation fails, manual deployment via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to **GitHub → Actions → CI/CD Pipeline**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select `main` branch
4. Click **Run workflow**

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

```bash
CI=false  # Treats warnings as warnings, not errors
```

### For Custom Deployment

Set these in your deployment platform:

```bash
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Alternative Deployment Platforms

### Vercel

```bash
# Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
# Auto-deploys on push to main
# Same CI/CD validation applies
```

### Netlify

```bash
# Build command: npm run build
# Publish directory: build
# Auto-deploys on push to main
```

### Custom Server

```bash
npm run build
# Serve the 'build' directory
# Configure SPA routing (serve index.html for all routes)
```
