## Developer Implementation Details

### Analytics Hooks Architecture

The portfolio uses a custom hook system for performance-optimized analytics:

**Core Analytics Components:**

**`AnalyticsProvider`** - Global analytics provider that initializes:

- `useScrollDepthTracking()` - Global scroll milestone tracking
- `useTimeTracking()` - Time-based engagement tracking

**`useAnalytics()`** - Main analytics hook providing:

- `trackSectionView()` - Section engagement tracking
- `trackContactForm()` - Form interaction funnel
- `trackProjectInteraction()` - Project engagement events
- `trackExternalLink()` - External link tracking
- `trackEngagement()` - User engagement metrics

**`useSectionTracking(sectionName)`** - Intersection Observer-based section tracking:

- Automatic view detection when 30% of section is visible
- Time-on-section measurement with 1-second minimum
- Scroll depth calculation at entry/exit points

**`useScrollDepthTracking()`** - Global scroll tracking:

- Milestone-based tracking: 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%
- RequestAnimationFrame optimization for smooth performance
- Automatic cleanup and memory management

**`useTimeTracking()`** - Time-based engagement:

- Interval tracking: 30s, 1m, 3m, 5m
- Non-blocking background measurement
- Session-based tracking with cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- **Zero Impact**: All tracking is asynchronous and non-blocking
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup of observers and timers
- **Debounced**: Events are throttled to prevent excessive API calls
- **Optimized**: Uses native browser APIs (Intersection Observer, RequestAnimationFrame)
