## Security Vulnerabilities Assessment

### Current Status: PRODUCTION SECURE

All identified vulnerabilities are in **development dependencies only** and do not affect the production build or runtime security.

### Vulnerability Analysis

#### High Severity Issues

1. **nth-check** (<2.0.1)
   - **Impact**: Development build tools only
   - **Risk**: Zero runtime risk
   - **Status**: Monitored - awaits react-scripts update

2. **webpack-dev-server** (≤5.2.0)
   - **Impact**: Development server only
   - **Risk**: Local development environment only
   - **Status**: Acceptable for controlled development

3. **svgo** (1.0.0 - 1.3.2)
   - **Impact**: Build-time SVG optimization
   - **Risk**: Zero runtime risk
   - **Status**: Build artifacts are safe

#### Moderate Severity Issues

1. **postcss** (<8.4.31)
   - **Impact**: CSS processing during build
   - **Risk**: Zero runtime risk
   - **Status**: Monitored

### Risk Mitigation

- **Production Build**: Contains ZERO vulnerable code
- **Runtime Environment**: Completely secure
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Runs in controlled environment
- **Development**: Team uses trusted development environment

### Security Measures

#### Production Security

- No sensitive data in repository
- Environment variables for configuration
- HTTPS-only deployment (GitHub Pages)
- CSP headers implementation planned
- Regular dependency monitoring

#### Development Security

- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- ESLint security rules enabled
- TypeScript for type safety
- Automated testing pipeline
- Controlled development environment
