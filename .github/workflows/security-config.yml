# Security Configuration for Workflows
# This file documents security best practices and configurations

# Global security settings that should be applied to all workflows:

security_settings:
  # Permissions: Use minimal required permissions
  permissions:
    contents: read # Default - most workflows only need read
    pages: write # Only for deployment workflows
    id-token: write # Only for OIDC authentication
    actions: read # Only when reading artifacts
    security-events: write # Only for security scanning

  # Timeout settings to prevent resource exhaustion
  timeouts:
    default_job: 30 # 30 minutes default
    quality_gates: 15 # 15 minutes for linting/testing
    build: 20 # 20 minutes for builds
    deployment: 15 # 15 minutes for deployments
    security_scan: 10 # 10 minutes for security scans

  # Environment protection rules
  environments:

        - wait_timer: 0
        - prevent_self_review: false

  # Secret management
  required_secrets:
    - GITHUB_TOKEN # Auto-provided by GitHub
    - REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID # Optional - for analytics

# Security best practices implemented:
security_features:
  - Minimal permissions principle
  - Pinned action versions (no @main or @latest)
  - Timeout configurations to prevent hanging
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Error handling with proper logging
  - Concurrency controls to prevent race conditions
  - Environment protection for production deployments
  - Security scanning in all pipelines
  - Artifact retention policies
  - No hardcoded secrets in code
  - OIDC authentication where possible
