## Security-First Approach (2025 Standards)

**Multi-layered security scanning** integrated into every deployment:

```yaml
CodeQL Analysis          # GitHub's semantic code analysis
Trivy Vulnerability Scan # Infrastructure & dependency scanning
SHA-Pinned Dependencies  # Immutable action versions
Minimal Permissions     # Least privilege access model
Security Event Logging  # SARIF format compliance
```

## Performance-Optimized Pipeline

**Build times consistently under 8 minutes** with advanced optimizations:

- **Parallel Job Execution**: Security, quality, and build run concurrently
- **Intelligent Caching**: NPM, build artifacts, and dependency caching
- **Matrix Testing**: Node.js 20 LTS & 22 Current
- **Optimized Dependencies**: `--prefer-offline` and retry mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI with custom thresholds

## Automated Workflows

### 1. **Release Pipeline** ([`release.yml`](workflows/release.yml))

**Triggers:** Push to `main` branch, manual dispatch  
**Purpose:** Automated semantic release with deployment to GitHub Pages

```bash
Trigger: Push to main branch
├── Security Analysis (CodeQL + Trivy)
├── Quality Gates (ESLint, TypeScript, Tests) - Matrix Node.js 20/22
├── Semantic Version Detection (pre-release support)
├── Production Build (with environment injection)
├── Semantic Release (automated changelog & tags)
├── GitHub Pages Deploy (with artifact validation)
└── Performance Monitor (Lighthouse CI)
```

**Pipeline Stages:**

- **Security Analysis**: CodeQL semantic analysis + Trivy vulnerability scanning with SARIF uploads
- **Quality Gates**: Matrix testing (Node.js 20/22), ESLint, TypeScript, Jest with coverage
- **Build Process**: Semantic release dry-run, production build with version injection
- **Release Management**: Automated versioning, changelog generation, and Git tagging
- **Secure Deploy**: GitHub Pages deployment with build artifact validation
- **Performance Monitor**: Lighthouse CI with automated reporting

**2025 Security Standards:**

- SHA-pinned actions for immutable dependencies
- Minimal permissions following least privilege principle
- Advanced caching with intelligent cache invalidation
- SARIF security reporting for vulnerability tracking
- Harden Runner protection against supply chain attacks

### 2. **PR Quality Checks** ([`pr-check.yml`](workflows/pr-check.yml))

**Triggers:** Pull request events (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review)  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive quality assurance for code changes

```bash
Trigger: Pull Request events (non-draft)
├── Quality Gates (Grouped logging) - Matrix Node.js 20/22
├── Build Validation (Production build test)
├── Build Artifact Validation (Essential files check)
├── Security Audit (npm audit + Trivy scan)
└── SARIF Security Upload (CodeQL integration)
```

**Features:**

- **Matrix Testing**: Node.js 20 LTS and 22 Current with timeout protection (25 minutes)
- **Professional Logging**: Grouped console output with GitHub Actions groups
- **Build Validation**: Production build test with artifact validation (15-minute timeout)
- **Security Integration**: npm security audit + Trivy vulnerability scanning with SARIF uploads
- **Essential File Checks**: Validates build produces required files (index.html, assets)
- **Quality Enforcement**: All checks must pass before merge eligibility

### 3. **Manual Deployment** ([`deploy.yml`](workflows/deploy.yml))

**Triggers:** Manual workflow dispatch ONLY (security-first design)
**Purpose:** Controlled override deployment with full accountability

```bash
Trigger: Manual workflow dispatch (with required reason)
├── Deploy Validation (Reason + initiator logging)
├── Quality Gates (Grouped execution)
├── Production Build (Environment injection + timeout)
├── Build Validation (Essential files + size check)
├── GitHub Pages Deploy
└── Performance Audit (Lighthouse CI)
```

**Features:**

- **Manual Control**: Workflow dispatch with force deploy option and required deployment reason
- **Accountability**: Required deployment reason input and initiator tracking
- **Professional Logging**: Deploy validation with reason, initiator, and grouped output
- **Build Validation**: Comprehensive validation including essential file checks (index.html)
- **Environment Injection**: Full React environment variables with build metadata
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-minute job timeout, 15-minute build timeout
- **Security**: NO automatic triggers - prevents accidental production deployments

### 4. **Emergency Hotfix** ([`hotfix.yml`](workflows/hotfix.yml))

**Triggers:** Manual dispatch only (emergency situations)
**Purpose:** Emergency deployment with optional test skipping

```bash
Trigger: Emergency manual dispatch
├── Emergency Validation (Reason logging)
├── Quality Checks (Type check + conditional tests)
├── Security Audit (Critical vulnerabilities)
├── Emergency Build (Hotfix versioning + timeout)
├── Build Size Validation (Large build warnings)
└── GitHub Pages Deploy
```

**Features:**

- **Emergency Controls**: Required description input, optional test skip with warnings
- **Conditional Testing**: Tests can be skipped for emergency deployment (with manual override)
- **Build Size Monitoring**: Warns if emergency build exceeds 10MB
- **Professional Logging**: Emergency validation with detailed reasoning
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-minute job timeout, 15-minute build timeout

## Configuration Details

### Environment Variables

```yaml
NODE_ENV: production
PUBLIC_URL: /portfolio
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP: false # Security - no source maps in production
INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK: false # Performance - better caching strategy
```

### Security Features (2025 Standards)

- **Minimal Permissions**: GitHub Token with least privilege access
- **SHA-Pinned Actions**: All actions locked to specific commit hashes
- **SARIF Security Reporting**: Standardized vulnerability format
- **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code security scanning
- **Trivy Scanning**: Infrastructure and dependency vulnerability detection
- **Concurrent Deployment Prevention**: Safe deployment practices

### Performance Optimizations

- **Multi-layer Caching**: NPM, build artifacts, and dependency caching
- **Parallel Execution**: Security, quality, and build jobs run concurrently
- **Matrix Testing**: Efficient cross-version Node.js testing
- **Build Optimization**: Source map removal, compression, retry mechanisms
- **Artifact Management**: Minimal retention for security compliance

## Deployment Metrics

### Performance Benchmarks

**Typical Deployment Times:**

- **Security Analysis**: 2-3 minutes (CodeQL + Trivy scanning)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Slow Deployments:**

1. Check cache status in workflow logs under "Restore dependencies cache"
2. Verify parallel job execution in Actions tab timeline view
3. Monitor bundle size trends in deployment summaries
4. Check GitHub Actions service status at status.github.com

**Failed Security Scans:**

1. Review CodeQL alerts in Security > Code scanning
2. Check Trivy vulnerability reports in workflow logs
3. Update dependencies if critical vulnerabilities found
4. Review SARIF uploads in Security > Code scanning

**Build Failures:**

1. Verify TypeScript compilation passes locally
2. Check ESLint errors in quality gates stage
3. Ensure all tests pass with `npm run test:ci`
4. Review build logs for dependency conflicts
