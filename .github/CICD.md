## Security-First Approach (2025 Standards)

**Multi-layered security scanning** integrated into every deployment:

```yaml
CodeQL Analysis          # GitHub's semantic code analysis
Trivy Vulnerability Scan # Infrastructure & dependency scanning
SHA-Pinned Dependencies  # Immutable action versions
Minimal Permissions     # Least privilege access model
Security Event Logging  # SARIF format compliance
```

## Performance-Optimized Pipeline

**Build times consistently under 8 minutes** with advanced optimizations:

- **Parallel Job Execution**: Security, quality, and build run concurrently
- **Intelligent Caching**: NPM, build artifacts, and dependency caching
- **Matrix Testing**: Node.js 20 LTS & 22 Current
- **Optimized Dependencies**: `--prefer-offline` and retry mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI with custom thresholds

## Automated Workflows

### 1. **Main Deployment** ([`deploy.yml`](workflows/deploy.yml))

**Triggers:** Push to `main` branch, manual dispatch  
**Purpose:** Production deployment to GitHub Pages

```bash
Trigger: Push to main branch
├── Security Analysis (CodeQL + Trivy)
├── Quality Gates (ESLint, TypeScript, Tests)
├── Optimized Build (Compression, cache)
├── GitHub Pages Deploy
└── Performance Audit (Lighthouse)
```

**Pipeline Stages:**

- **Security Analysis**: CodeQL semantic analysis + Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Quality Gates**: Multi-Node.js testing, ESLint, TypeScript, Jest tests
- **Optimized Build**: Production build with compression and caching
- **Secure Deploy**: GitHub Pages deployment with environment protection
- **Performance Monitor**: Lighthouse CI with strict quality thresholds

**2025 Security Standards:**

- SHA-pinned actions for immutable dependencies
- Minimal permissions following least privilege principle
- Advanced caching with intelligent cache invalidation
- SARIF security reporting for vulnerability tracking
- Harden Runner protection against supply chain attacks

### 2. **PR Quality Checks** ([`pr-check.yml`](workflows/pr-check.yml))

**Triggers:** Pull request events  
**Purpose:** Quality assurance for code changes

```bash
Trigger: Pull Request events
├── Security Scan (Trivy vulnerability analysis)
├── Multi-Node Testing (20 LTS, 22 Current)
├── Bundle Size Analysis
└── Automated Status Reports
```

**Features:**

- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability analysis for all PRs
- **Matrix Testing**: Node.js 20 LTS and 22 Current versions
- **Bundle Analysis**: Automated bundle size monitoring
- **Status Reporting**: Intelligent PR comments with detailed analysis
- **Quality Enforcement**: All checks must pass before merge eligibility

### 3. **Dependency Updates** ([`dependabot.yml`](dependabot.yml))

**Purpose:** Automated dependency updates  
**Schedule:** Weekly on Mondays at 04:00 UTC

```bash
Schedule: Weekly on Mondays
├── NPM Dependencies (security-focused)
├── GitHub Actions updates
├── Automated PR creation
└── Maintainer assignment
```

**Features:**

- **NPM Dependencies**: Automated package updates with security focus
- **GitHub Actions**: Keep workflow actions current with latest versions
- **Selective Updates**: Strategic filtering to prevent unnecessary noise
- **Review Assignment**: Automatic assignment to repository maintainer

## Configuration Details

### Environment Variables

```yaml
NODE_ENV: production
PUBLIC_URL: /portfolio
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP: false # Security - no source maps in production
INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK: false # Performance - better caching strategy
```

### Security Features (2025 Standards)

- **Minimal Permissions**: GitHub Token with least privilege access
- **SHA-Pinned Actions**: All actions locked to specific commit hashes
- **SARIF Security Reporting**: Standardized vulnerability format
- **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code security scanning
- **Trivy Scanning**: Infrastructure and dependency vulnerability detection
- **Concurrent Deployment Prevention**: Safe deployment practices

### Performance Optimizations

- **Multi-layer Caching**: NPM, build artifacts, and dependency caching
- **Parallel Execution**: Security, quality, and build jobs run concurrently
- **Matrix Testing**: Efficient cross-version Node.js testing
- **Build Optimization**: Source map removal, compression, retry mechanisms
- **Artifact Management**: Minimal retention for security compliance

## Deployment Metrics

### Performance Benchmarks

**Typical Deployment Times:**

- **Security Analysis**: 2-3 minutes (CodeQL + Trivy scanning)
- **Quality Gates**: 3-4 minutes (Multi-Node.js matrix testing)
- **Build & Deploy**: 2-3 minutes (Optimized with caching)
- **Performance Audit**: 1-2 minutes (Lighthouse CI)
- **Total Pipeline**: 6-8 minutes consistently

**Optimization Factors:**

- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80%+ reduces build time by 40%
- **Parallel Jobs**: 3x faster than sequential execution
- **Bundle Size**: 132KB (gzipped) for optimal loading
- **Performance Scores**: 90%+ across all Lighthouse metrics

### Quality Standards Enforced

```yaml
Performance Score: ≥90 # Core Web Vitals compliance
Accessibility: ≥95 # WCAG AA+ compliance
Best Practices: ≥90 # Industry standards
SEO Score: ≥90 # Search optimization
First Contentful Paint: <2s # Loading performance
Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1 # Visual stability
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Slow Deployments:**

1. Check cache status in workflow logs under "Restore dependencies cache"
2. Verify parallel job execution in Actions tab timeline view
3. Monitor bundle size trends in deployment summaries
4. Check GitHub Actions service status at status.github.com

**Failed Security Scans:**

1. Review CodeQL alerts in Security > Code scanning
2. Check Trivy vulnerability reports in workflow logs
3. Update dependencies if critical vulnerabilities found
4. Review SARIF uploads in Security > Code scanning

**Build Failures:**

1. Verify TypeScript compilation passes locally
2. Check ESLint errors in quality gates stage
3. Ensure all tests pass with `npm run test:ci`
4. Review build logs for dependency conflicts

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Automated Monitoring

- **Workflow Execution Metrics**: Success rates, execution times, failure patterns
- **Security Posture**: Vulnerability trends, dependency health, compliance status
- **Performance Tracking**: Lighthouse scores, bundle size evolution, Core Web Vitals
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, code quality scores, technical debt

### Advanced Features

- **Performance Budget Enforcement**: Automated bundle size limits
- **Security Alert Integration**: Real-time vulnerability notifications
- **Deployment Health Checks**: Post-deployment validation and rollback
- **Multi-environment Support**: Staging and production deployment pipelines
